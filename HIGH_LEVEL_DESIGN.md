## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Architecture Style
**Event-Driven Microservices Architecture** with the following characteristics:
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via events and APIs
- **High Cohesion**: Each service owns a specific business domain
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade across the system
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use optimal technology stack

### Core Architectural Principles

#### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
```
Business Domains:
├── Authentication & Authorization
├── Problem Management  
├── Code Submission & Execution
├── Payment & Subscription
├── Search & Discovery
├── AI-Powered Assistance
└── Administrative Operations
```

#### 2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
- **Commands**: Modify system state (Create, Update, Delete)
- **Queries**: Read system state without side effects
- **Separation**: Different models and paths for reads vs writes

#### 3. **Event Sourcing Patterns**
- **Domain Events**: Capture business-significant occurrences
- **Event Store**: RabbitMQ for reliable event delivery
- **Event Handlers**: Asynchronous processing of business events
